# Setting up the structure of the project
 1. First of all i have created this raw strcture of the project to have the picture in my mind like what i have to do in the project.
                 ![raw dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84536185/197188613-2d6842cd-3838-45a5-af92-1f73a6be65d1.png)
2. Then i have converte the given data set of CSV file to JSON to easily manipulate the data according to the requirements. Then the main task was to create a file with necessary functions to manipulate the data. So i have converted the data in json as a year wise format so my iterations would be less.
